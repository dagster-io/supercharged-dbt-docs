- This data is enhanced with additional license, subscription, CRM account, and billing attributes for ease of analysis

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude non-production SaaS installations (ex: `staging.gitlab.com`)

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- License / Subscription Logic:
  - `latest_subscription_id` reflects the most recent available subscription_id `WHERE subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`. This is not necessarily the subscription_id at the time of ping generation
  - `is_program_subscription` = TRUE `WHERE product_rate_plan_name LIKE ('%edu%' or '%oss%')`
  - `product_delivery_type = 'Self-Managed'`
  - `product_rate_plan_name NOT IN ('Premium - 1 Year - Eval')`
  - `charge_type = 'Recurring'`
- The installation's subscription information reflects the plan at time of ping generation
  - The exception is `latest_subscription_id` which reflects the most recent available subscription_id associated with the installation's subscription at time of ping generation
- `Inherited` - `is_last_ping_of_month` = last ping created per calendar month per installation (`dim_installation_id`)

**Other Comments:**
- This model is built to have one record per Service Ping and therefore does not contain any metric-level data
- GitLab implementations can be Customer Hosted (Self-Managed), GitLab Hosted (referred to as SaaS or Dotcom data) or GitLab Dedicated Hosted (where each Installation is Hosted by GitLab but on Separate Servers).  
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 21:T468a,

    FROM final32:Tcb6, **Description:** Enriched instance Service Ping data for the last ping of the month per installation by ping and metric for 7-day metrics. This is an enhanced version of `fct_ping_instance_metric_weekly` and is defined using the [`macro_mart_ping_instance_metric`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/macro/macro.gitlab_snowflake.macro_mart_ping_instance_metric) macro. 
- This data is enhanced with additional license, subscription, CRM account, and billing attributes for ease of analysis

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude non-production SaaS installations (ex: `staging.gitlab.com`)
- Exclude metrics with non-numeric or negative values (`TRY_TO_DECIMAL(metric_value::TEXT) >= 0`)
- `Inherited` - Exclude metrics that timed out during ping generation
- `Inherited` - Include 7-day metrics (`time_frame = '7d'`)
- `Inherited` - Include metrics from the 'Last Ping of the Week' pings

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- License / Subscription Logic:
  - `latest_subscription_id` reflects the most recent available subscription_id `WHERE subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`. This is not necessarily the subscription_id at the time of ping generation
  - `is_program_subscription` = TRUE `WHERE product_rate_plan_name LIKE ('%edu%' or '%oss%')`
  - `product_delivery_type = 'Self-Managed'`
  - `product_rate_plan_name NOT IN ('Premium - 1 Year - Eval')`
  - `charge_type = 'Recurring'`
- The installation's subscription information reflects the plan at time of ping generation. (The exception is `latest_subscription_id` which reflects the most recent available subscription_id associated with the installation's subscription at time of ping generation
- `Inherited` - `is_last_ping_of_week` = last ping created per calendar week per installation (`dim_installation_id`)

**Other Comments:**
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- Metric time frames are set in the metric definition yaml file and can be found in the [Service Ping Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/)
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 33:T54cc,

- Atomic (lowest grain) data with a single record per ping
- Includes installation, instance, date, product, billing, and subscription identifiers

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- `Inherited` - `uuid IS NOT NULL` (uuid is synonymous with dim_instance_id)
- `Inherited` - `version NOT LIKE '%VERSION%`

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- `is_trial` = `IFF(ping_created_at < license_trial_ends_on, TRUE, FALSE)`
- `dim_subscription_id` = `COALESCE(ping_payload.license_subscription_id, prep_subscription.dim_subscription_id)`
- `umau_value` = metric value from `usage_activity_by_stage_monthly.manage.events`

**Other Comments:**
- The `fct_ping_instance` table is built directly from the [prep_ping_instance table](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.prep_ping_instance) which brings in Instance Service Ping data one record per Service Ping.  Along with the Instance information a 'Payload' column with an array of Metrics is captured in the Service Ping.
- Sums, Counts and Percents of Usage (called metrics) is captured along with the Implementation Information at the Instance Level and sent to GitLab. The Instance Owner determines whether Service Ping data will be sent or not.
- GitLab implementations can be Customer Hosted (Self-Managed), GitLab Hosted (referred to as SaaS or Dotcom data) or GitLab Dedicated Hosted (where each Installation is Hosted by GitLab but on Separate Servers).  
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- Multiple Instances can be hosted on each Implementation. Multiple Installations can be included within each Instance which is determined by Host_id. (Instance_id || Host_id = Installation_id)
- Service Ping data is captured at a particular point in time with `all-time, 7_day and 28_day` metrics.  The metrics are only pertinent to the Ping Date and Time and can not be aggregated across Ping Dates. Service Pings are normally compared WoW, MoM, YoY,  etc.  
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 38:T3e18,

    FROM final3b:Tc47, **Description:** Enriched instance Service Ping data by ping and metric for 7-day metrics. This is an enhanced version of `fct_ping_instance_metric_7_day` and is defined using the [`macro_mart_ping_instance_metric`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/macro/macro.gitlab_snowflake.macro_mart_ping_instance_metric) macro. 
- This data is enhanced with additional license, subscription, CRM account, and billing attributes for ease of analysis

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude non-production SaaS installations (ex: `staging.gitlab.com`)
- Exclude metrics with non-numeric or negative values (`TRY_TO_DECIMAL(metric_value::TEXT) >= 0`)
- `Inherited` - Include 7-day metrics (`time_frame = '7d'`)

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- License / Subscription Logic:
  - `latest_subscription_id` reflects the most recent available subscription_id `WHERE subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`. This is not necessarily the subscription_id at the time of ping generation
  - `is_program_subscription` = TRUE `WHERE product_rate_plan_name LIKE ('%edu%' or '%oss%')`
  - `product_delivery_type = 'Self-Managed'`
  - `product_rate_plan_name NOT IN ('Premium - 1 Year - Eval')`
  - `charge_type = 'Recurring'`
- The installation's subscription information reflects the plan at time of ping generation
  - The exception is `latest_subscription_id` which reflects the most recent available subscription_id associated with the installation's subscription at time of ping generation
- `Inherited` - Metrics that timed out (return -1) are set to a value of 0
- `Inherited` - `is_last_ping_of_month` = last ping created per calendar month per installation (`dim_installation_id`)

**Other Comments:**
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- Metric time frames are set in the metric definition yaml file and can be found in the [Service Ping Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/)
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 3c:T54cc,

    FROM final3f:Tc4b, **Description:** Enriched instance Service Ping data by ping and metric for 28-day metrics. This is an enhanced version of `fct_ping_instance_metric_28_day` and is defined using the [`macro_mart_ping_instance_metric`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/macro/macro.gitlab_snowflake.macro_mart_ping_instance_metric) macro. 
- This data is enhanced with additional license, subscription, CRM account, and billing attributes for ease of analysis

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude non-production SaaS installations (ex: `staging.gitlab.com`)
- Exclude metrics with non-numeric or negative values (`TRY_TO_DECIMAL(metric_value::TEXT) >= 0`)
- `Inherited` - Include 28-day metrics (`time_frame = '28d'`)

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- License / Subscription Logic:
  - `latest_subscription_id` reflects the most recent available subscription_id `WHERE subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`. This is not necessarily the subscription_id at the time of ping generation
  - `is_program_subscription` = TRUE `WHERE product_rate_plan_name LIKE ('%edu%' or '%oss%')`
  - `product_delivery_type = 'Self-Managed'`
  - `product_rate_plan_name NOT IN ('Premium - 1 Year - Eval')`
  - `charge_type = 'Recurring'`
- The installation's subscription information reflects the plan at time of ping generation
  - The exception is `latest_subscription_id` which reflects the most recent available subscription_id associated with the installation's subscription at time of ping generation
- `Inherited` - Metrics that timed out (return -1) are set to a value of 0
- `Inherited` - `is_last_ping_of_month` = last ping created per calendar month per installation (`dim_installation_id`)

**Other Comments:**
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- Metric time frames are set in the metric definition yaml file and can be found in the [Service Ping Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/)
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 40:T54cc,

- This data is enhanced with additional license, subscription, CRM account, and billing attributes for ease of analysis

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude non-production SaaS installations (ex: `staging.gitlab.com`)
- Exclude metrics with non-numeric or negative values (`TRY_TO_DECIMAL(metric_value::TEXT) >= 0`)
- `Inherited` - Exclude metrics that timed out during ping generation
- `Inherited` - Include 28-day and all-time metrics (`time_frame IN ('28d', 'all')`)
- `Inherited` - Include metrics from the 'Last Ping of the Month' pings

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- License / Subscription Logic:
  - `latest_subscription_id` reflects the most recent available subscription_id `WHERE subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`. This is not necessarily the subscription_id at the time of ping generation
  - `is_program_subscription` = TRUE `WHERE product_rate_plan_name LIKE ('%edu%' or '%oss%')`
  - `ping_deployment_type IN ('Self-Managed', 'SaaS')`
  - `product_rate_plan_name NOT IN ('Premium - 1 Year - Eval')`
  - `charge_type = 'Recurring'`
- The installation's subscription information reflects the plan at time of ping generation
  - The exception is `latest_subscription_id` which reflects the most recent available subscription_id associated with the installation's subscription at time of ping generation
- `Inherited` - `is_last_ping_of_month` = last ping created per calendar month per installation (`dim_installation_id`)

**Other Comments:**
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- Metric time frames are set in the metric definition yaml file and can be found in the [Service Ping Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/)
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 47:T4e28,

SELECT *
FROM joined4c:Tc51, **Description:** Enriched instance Service Ping data by ping and metric for all-time metrics. This is an enhanced version of `fct_ping_instance_metric_all_time` and is defined using the [`macro_mart_ping_instance_metric`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/macro/macro.gitlab_snowflake.macro_mart_ping_instance_metric) macro. 
- This data is enhanced with additional license, subscription, CRM account, and billing attributes for ease of analysis

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude non-production SaaS installations (ex: `staging.gitlab.com`)
- Exclude metrics with non-numeric or negative values (`TRY_TO_DECIMAL(metric_value::TEXT) >= 0`)
- `Inherited` - Include all-time metrics (`time_frame = 'all'`)

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- License / Subscription Logic:
  - `latest_subscription_id` reflects the most recent available subscription_id `WHERE subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`. This is not necessarily the subscription_id at the time of ping generation
  - `is_program_subscription` = TRUE `WHERE product_rate_plan_name LIKE ('%edu%' or '%oss%')`
  - `product_delivery_type = 'Self-Managed'`
  - `product_rate_plan_name NOT IN ('Premium - 1 Year - Eval')`
  - `charge_type = 'Recurring'`
- The installation's subscription information reflects the plan at time of ping generation
  - The exception is `latest_subscription_id` which reflects the most recent available subscription_id associated with the installation's subscription at time of ping generation
- `Inherited` - Metrics that timed out (return -1) are set to a value of 0
- `Inherited` - `is_last_ping_of_month` = last ping created per calendar month per installation (`dim_installation_id`)

**Other Comments:**
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- Metric time frames are set in the metric definition yaml file and can be found in the [Service Ping Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/)
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 4d:T54ce,

The below query will pull ARR by month. You can add additional dimensions to the query to build out your analysis.

SELECT
  arr_month,
  SUM(arr)  AS arr
FROM "PROD"."LEGACY"."MART_ARR"
WHERE arr_month < DATE_TRUNC('month',CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC

Charges_month_by_month CTE:

This CTE amortizes the ARR by month over the effective term of the rate plan charges. There are 4 subscription statuses in Zuora: active, cancelled, draft and expired. The Zuora UI reporting modules use a filter of WHERE subscription_status NOT IN ('Draft','Expired') which is also applied in this query. Please see the column definitions for additional details.

The model uses the subscription_lineage grain to calculate the Delta ARR. This is a fundamental change from previous Delta ARR models at the subscription grain. When looking at the subscription grain, debook-book scenarios are not captured. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the subscription_lineage grain for accurate product level Delta ARR changes. This model provides a method to analyze the 6 subscription linkage scenarios provided in this [Linking Subscriptions for Data Retention](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SYFy0Xqau1dbOm2YXmp0NvWDEkL_vIcWaFhKzwcocCM/edit#gid=0) file.

The model ERD can be found [HERE](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/invitations/accept/inv_07d25d39-3076-408f-b768-67d1895ea064). 

Model Validation:

The model ties out 100% to mart_arr with the below 3 exceptions:

1. The model removes subscriptions with data quality problems in the subscription_name_slugify field that is used for the subscription lineage. These were 5 subscriptions at the time of model creation and they do not have a material impact on the model insights.

1. The model removes Storage product charges. The model is intended to focus on the paid plan tiers only.

1. At the time of model creation, there were 23 subscriptions that were part of lineages where subscriptions in the lineage roll up to different Salesforce ultimate parent accounts. All of the ARR for these subscriptions is in the model; however, the model rolls up the ARR for these subscriptions to the ultimate parent account of the oldest subscription in the lineage. This results in these 23 parent accounts not tieing out 100% to mart_arr.

Model Caveat:

1. It should be that a subscription only has 1 paid tier plan attached to it. However, there are a small minority of subscriptions that have more than 1 product. Therefore, it is necessary to put the product tiers into an array in the model for completeness. In virtually all cases, it is 2 product tiers on the subscription with many of them having old Bronze/Starter plans in addition to Premium plans.6b:T266d,

For xMAU/PI reporting, this model is used to determine the total number of active Self-Managed subscriptions on a given month and what percent of subscriptions sent a ping from a given version. It can also be used to determine what percent of subscriptions sent a ping on a given month, etc. 
- The version an installation is reporting on (major_minor_version_id), seat count (licensed_user_count), and count of pings sent that month (ping_count) are also included
- Unpaid subscriptions (ex: OSS, EDU) are _included_ in this model

**Data Grain:**
- ping_created_date_month
- latest_subscription_id
- dim_installation_id (only populated if subscription sent a ping that month)

_Important caveat:_ The grain of this model is slightly different depending on whether a subscription sent a ping that month. It is advised to look at the `MAX()` value, grouped by `latest_subscription_id`.
- If a subscription sent a ping that month, there is 1 record per subscription per installation reporting. (Note: a subscription can be associated with > 1 installation, so a single subscription could have multiple records for a given month)
- If a subscription did not send a ping that month, there is 1 record per subscription where `dim_installation_id IS NULL`

Example query

```
WITH subscription_level AS (

  SELECT
    ping_created_date_month,
    latest_subscription_id,
    COUNT(dim_installation_id) AS installation_count,
    MAX(has_sent_pings) AS has_sent_pings,
    MAX(licensed_user_count) AS seat_count
  FROM common_mart_product.rpt_ping_latest_subscriptions_monthly
  GROUP BY 1,2

)

SELECT
  ping_created_date_month,
  COUNT(latest_subscription_id) AS subscription_count,
  COUNT(IFF(has_sent_pings = TRUE, latest_subscription_id, NULL)) AS sent_ping_count,
  DIV0(sent_ping_count, subscription_count) AS subscription_ping_opt_in_rate
FROM subscription_level
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
;
```

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Include subscriptions where:
  - `product_delivery_type = 'Self-Managed'` 
  - `subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`
  - `product_tier_name <> 'Storage'`
- `major_minor_version_id`, `version_is_prerelease`, and `instance_user_count` look at 'Last Ping of the Month' pings
- Exclude the current month

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- If a ping is received from an installation with a license mapped to a subscription but no corresponding record is found in `fct_charge`, a record is still included in the model where `is_missing_charge_subscription = FALSE`. In this case, the most recent record available in `fct_charge` is used to determine the number of seats associated with the subscription.
- For a given month, all records associated with a subscription will have the same seat count (`licensed_user_count`) since that value is tied to the subscription, not an installation 7e:T31f8,

report provides the 8th calendar day snapshot for the mart_delta_arr_parent_product_month table. It uses the rpt_delta_arr_parent_month_8th_calendar_day to build the table.\n\nCustom Business Logic:\n\n1. The parent/child crm account hierarchy changes on a monthly basis. The ARR snapshot table captures the account hierarchy on the 8th calendar day. When doing month over month calcs, this can result in accounts showing as churn in the snapshot data, but in reality, they just changed account hierarchies and did not churn. Therefore, we use the live crm account hierarchy in this model to remove the error that results from looking at snapshot account hierarchies.\n\n2. We started snapshotting the product ranking in August 2022. Therefore, we have to use the live product ranking to backfill the data. In the future, this can be refined to use a dim_product_detail snapshot table when it is built.","meta":{},"docs":{"show":true},"patch_path":"gitlab_snowflake://models/common_mart_sales/restricted_safe/reports/schema.yml","compiled_path":"target/compiled/gitlab_snowflake/models/common_mart_sales/restricted_safe/reports/rpt_delta_arr_parent_product_month_8th_calendar_day.sql","build_path":null,"deferred":false,"unrendered_config":{"database":"{{

report provides the 8th calendar day snapshot for the mart_delta_arr_parent_month table. It uses the rpt_delta_arr_parent_month_8th_calendar_day to build the table.\n\nCustom Business Logic:\n\n1. The parent/child crm account hierarchy changes on a monthly basis. The ARR snapshot table captures the account hierarchy on the 8th calendar day. When doing month over month calcs, this can result in accounts showing as churn in the snapshot data, but in reality, they just changed account hierarchies and did not churn. Therefore, we use the live crm account hierarchy in this model to remove the error that results from looking at snapshot account hierarchies.\n\n2. We started snapshotting the product ranking in August 2022. Therefore, we have to use the live product ranking to backfill the data.
