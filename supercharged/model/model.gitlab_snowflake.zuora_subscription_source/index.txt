- This data is enhanced with additional license, subscription, CRM account, and billing attributes for ease of analysis

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude non-production SaaS installations (ex: `staging.gitlab.com`)

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- License / Subscription Logic:
  - `latest_subscription_id` reflects the most recent available subscription_id `WHERE subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`. This is not necessarily the subscription_id at the time of ping generation
  - `is_program_subscription` = TRUE `WHERE product_rate_plan_name LIKE ('%edu%' or '%oss%')`
  - `product_delivery_type = 'Self-Managed'`
  - `product_rate_plan_name NOT IN ('Premium - 1 Year - Eval')`
  - `charge_type = 'Recurring'`
- The installation's subscription information reflects the plan at time of ping generation
  - The exception is `latest_subscription_id` which reflects the most recent available subscription_id associated with the installation's subscription at time of ping generation
- `Inherited` - `is_last_ping_of_month` = last ping created per calendar month per installation (`dim_installation_id`)

**Other Comments:**
- This model is built to have one record per Service Ping and therefore does not contain any metric-level data
- GitLab implementations can be Customer Hosted (Self-Managed), GitLab Hosted (referred to as SaaS or Dotcom data) or GitLab Dedicated Hosted (where each Installation is Hosted by GitLab but on Separate Servers).  
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 17:T468a,

    FROM manual_charges1c:Tcb6, **Description:** Enriched instance Service Ping data for the last ping of the month per installation by ping and metric for 7-day metrics. This is an enhanced version of `fct_ping_instance_metric_weekly` and is defined using the [`macro_mart_ping_instance_metric`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/macro/macro.gitlab_snowflake.macro_mart_ping_instance_metric) macro. 
- This data is enhanced with additional license, subscription, CRM account, and billing attributes for ease of analysis

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude non-production SaaS installations (ex: `staging.gitlab.com`)
- Exclude metrics with non-numeric or negative values (`TRY_TO_DECIMAL(metric_value::TEXT) >= 0`)
- `Inherited` - Exclude metrics that timed out during ping generation
- `Inherited` - Include 7-day metrics (`time_frame = '7d'`)
- `Inherited` - Include metrics from the 'Last Ping of the Week' pings

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- License / Subscription Logic:
  - `latest_subscription_id` reflects the most recent available subscription_id `WHERE subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`. This is not necessarily the subscription_id at the time of ping generation
  - `is_program_subscription` = TRUE `WHERE product_rate_plan_name LIKE ('%edu%' or '%oss%')`
  - `product_delivery_type = 'Self-Managed'`
  - `product_rate_plan_name NOT IN ('Premium - 1 Year - Eval')`
  - `charge_type = 'Recurring'`
- The installation's subscription information reflects the plan at time of ping generation. (The exception is `latest_subscription_id` which reflects the most recent available subscription_id associated with the installation's subscription at time of ping generation
- `Inherited` - `is_last_ping_of_week` = last ping created per calendar week per installation (`dim_installation_id`)

**Other Comments:**
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- Metric time frames are set in the metric definition yaml file and can be found in the [Service Ping Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/)
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 1d:T54cc,

1e:Tc47, **Description:** Enriched instance Service Ping data by ping and metric for 7-day metrics. This is an enhanced version of `fct_ping_instance_metric_7_day` and is defined using the [`macro_mart_ping_instance_metric`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/macro/macro.gitlab_snowflake.macro_mart_ping_instance_metric) macro. 
- This data is enhanced with additional license, subscription, CRM account, and billing attributes for ease of analysis

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude non-production SaaS installations (ex: `staging.gitlab.com`)
- Exclude metrics with non-numeric or negative values (`TRY_TO_DECIMAL(metric_value::TEXT) >= 0`)
- `Inherited` - Include 7-day metrics (`time_frame = '7d'`)

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- License / Subscription Logic:
  - `latest_subscription_id` reflects the most recent available subscription_id `WHERE subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`. This is not necessarily the subscription_id at the time of ping generation
  - `is_program_subscription` = TRUE `WHERE product_rate_plan_name LIKE ('%edu%' or '%oss%')`
  - `product_delivery_type = 'Self-Managed'`
  - `product_rate_plan_name NOT IN ('Premium - 1 Year - Eval')`
  - `charge_type = 'Recurring'`
- The installation's subscription information reflects the plan at time of ping generation
  - The exception is `latest_subscription_id` which reflects the most recent available subscription_id associated with the installation's subscription at time of ping generation
- `Inherited` - Metrics that timed out (return -1) are set to a value of 0
- `Inherited` - `is_last_ping_of_month` = last ping created per calendar month per installation (`dim_installation_id`)

**Other Comments:**
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- Metric time frames are set in the metric definition yaml file and can be found in the [Service Ping Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/)
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 1f:T54cc,

20:Tc4b, **Description:** Enriched instance Service Ping data by ping and metric for 28-day metrics. This is an enhanced version of `fct_ping_instance_metric_28_day` and is defined using the [`macro_mart_ping_instance_metric`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/macro/macro.gitlab_snowflake.macro_mart_ping_instance_metric) macro. 
- This data is enhanced with additional license, subscription, CRM account, and billing attributes for ease of analysis

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude non-production SaaS installations (ex: `staging.gitlab.com`)
- Exclude metrics with non-numeric or negative values (`TRY_TO_DECIMAL(metric_value::TEXT) >= 0`)
- `Inherited` - Include 28-day metrics (`time_frame = '28d'`)

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- License / Subscription Logic:
  - `latest_subscription_id` reflects the most recent available subscription_id `WHERE subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`. This is not necessarily the subscription_id at the time of ping generation
  - `is_program_subscription` = TRUE `WHERE product_rate_plan_name LIKE ('%edu%' or '%oss%')`
  - `product_delivery_type = 'Self-Managed'`
  - `product_rate_plan_name NOT IN ('Premium - 1 Year - Eval')`
  - `charge_type = 'Recurring'`
- The installation's subscription information reflects the plan at time of ping generation
  - The exception is `latest_subscription_id` which reflects the most recent available subscription_id associated with the installation's subscription at time of ping generation
- `Inherited` - Metrics that timed out (return -1) are set to a value of 0
- `Inherited` - `is_last_ping_of_month` = last ping created per calendar month per installation (`dim_installation_id`)

**Other Comments:**
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- Metric time frames are set in the metric definition yaml file and can be found in the [Service Ping Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/)
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 21:T54cc,

- This data is enhanced with additional license, subscription, CRM account, and billing attributes for ease of analysis

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude non-production SaaS installations (ex: `staging.gitlab.com`)
- Exclude metrics with non-numeric or negative values (`TRY_TO_DECIMAL(metric_value::TEXT) >= 0`)
- `Inherited` - Exclude metrics that timed out during ping generation
- `Inherited` - Include 28-day and all-time metrics (`time_frame IN ('28d', 'all')`)
- `Inherited` - Include metrics from the 'Last Ping of the Month' pings

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- License / Subscription Logic:
  - `latest_subscription_id` reflects the most recent available subscription_id `WHERE subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`. This is not necessarily the subscription_id at the time of ping generation
  - `is_program_subscription` = TRUE `WHERE product_rate_plan_name LIKE ('%edu%' or '%oss%')`
  - `ping_deployment_type IN ('Self-Managed', 'SaaS')`
  - `product_rate_plan_name NOT IN ('Premium - 1 Year - Eval')`
  - `charge_type = 'Recurring'`
- The installation's subscription information reflects the plan at time of ping generation
  - The exception is `latest_subscription_id` which reflects the most recent available subscription_id associated with the installation's subscription at time of ping generation
- `Inherited` - `is_last_ping_of_month` = last ping created per calendar month per installation (`dim_installation_id`)

**Other Comments:**
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- Metric time frames are set in the metric definition yaml file and can be found in the [Service Ping Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/)
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 24:T4e28,

    FROM joined27:Tc51, **Description:** Enriched instance Service Ping data by ping and metric for all-time metrics. This is an enhanced version of `fct_ping_instance_metric_all_time` and is defined using the [`macro_mart_ping_instance_metric`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/macro/macro.gitlab_snowflake.macro_mart_ping_instance_metric) macro. 
- This data is enhanced with additional license, subscription, CRM account, and billing attributes for ease of analysis

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude non-production SaaS installations (ex: `staging.gitlab.com`)
- Exclude metrics with non-numeric or negative values (`TRY_TO_DECIMAL(metric_value::TEXT) >= 0`)
- `Inherited` - Include all-time metrics (`time_frame = 'all'`)

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- License / Subscription Logic:
  - `latest_subscription_id` reflects the most recent available subscription_id `WHERE subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`. This is not necessarily the subscription_id at the time of ping generation
  - `is_program_subscription` = TRUE `WHERE product_rate_plan_name LIKE ('%edu%' or '%oss%')`
  - `product_delivery_type = 'Self-Managed'`
  - `product_rate_plan_name NOT IN ('Premium - 1 Year - Eval')`
  - `charge_type = 'Recurring'`
- The installation's subscription information reflects the plan at time of ping generation
  - The exception is `latest_subscription_id` which reflects the most recent available subscription_id associated with the installation's subscription at time of ping generation
- `Inherited` - Metrics that timed out (return -1) are set to a value of 0
- `Inherited` - `is_last_ping_of_month` = last ping created per calendar month per installation (`dim_installation_id`)

**Other Comments:**
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- Metric time frames are set in the metric definition yaml file and can be found in the [Service Ping Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/)
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow. 28:T54ce,

This incorporates logic from previous processes which includes taking opportunity-subscription connections from quotes, invoices, and the subscription object itself. Based on the created date, term dates, or subscription name, we fill in missing opportunity ids.

 The process is described in this [flow diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/e7661694-61ed-4317-b648-d054be9aff0e/edit?viewport_loc=-76%2C296%2C3590%2C1856%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_f50ea2e1-1ea8-47ca-b950-75b723273b00)

 The final result yields the distinct combination of subscriptions and opportunities with the best match based on the rules defined in the flow diagram.

 For self-service subscriptions:
 - Take the opportunity_id from the subscription object
 - Using the quote_number from the subscription's invoice, get the opportunity_id from the opportunity which has that quote_number on it.
 - Out of all quotes, take any opportunity_id where the quote has the subscription_id on it.
 - Fill forward/backwards when the subscription created dates are the same.
 - Fill forward/backwards when the subscription term dates are the same.
 - Fill forward when the subscription name is the same.

 For sales-assisted subscriptions:
 - Take the opportunity_id from the subscription object if it was created after 2021-04-11. This is when automation was set up to reliably relate subscriptions and opportunities.
 - Using the quote_number from the subscription object, get the opportunity_id from the opportunity which has that quote_number on it.
 - Using the quote_number from the subscription's invoice, get the opportunity_id from the opportunity which has that quote_number on it.
 - Out of all quotes, take any opportunity_id where the quote has the subscription_id on it.
 - Fill forward/backwards when the subscription created dates are the same.
 - Fill forward/backwards when the subscription term dates are the same.
 - Fill forward when the subscription name is the same.

 In both cases there where multiple opportunities are assigned to a single subscription. This can be caused by a variety of reasons, and we apply the following logic to all subscriptions to determine which opportunity is the best match:
 - Select the opportunity whith the amount that matches the amount on the subscription's invoice. This is the best solution for when a subscription is one of many on an invoice, and we need to match up each subscription with the appropriate opportunity.
 - Select the opportunity created first if all of the possible opportunities' amounts sums to the amount on the subscription's invoices. This is the best solution for when a subscription is billed on multiple invoices and new opportunity is created for each invoice. Ex. Ramp deals
 - If the subscription is self-service and has an opportunity_id on the subscription object, take the opportunity_id from the subscription object.
 - If the subscription is sales_assisted and there is a quote_number on the subscription, take the opportunity_id from the opportunity associated with this quote_number.
 - If all of the methods for finding an opportunity-subscription mapping match for one record, select this subscription-opportunity pair.2b:Ta5ca,WITH zuora_account_source AS (

    FROM final_matches_with_long_oppty_id2c:T539,This table is the base table for Zuora subscriptions.

It removes all subscriptions that are marked as "Exclude from Analysis". It also creates a slug of the subscription name and the renewal subscription name (if it exists) using the user-defined function (UDF) "zuora_slugify". There is a test specifically to validate this.

This table also sets the zuora_renewal_subscription_name_slugify field as an array. This is important because we need to do deduplication downstream and can't have a fan out at this stage. Storing the data as an array enables us to still clean it with the slugify UDF while still having a single row.

#### Zuora Slugify UDF
This function is used to simplify Zuora subscriptions names. Subscription names, by default, are unique. However, they can have basically any character they want in them, including arbitrary amounts of whitespace. The original idea was to truly slugify the name but that wasn't unique enough across subscriptions. We did have an issue where links to renewal subscriptions were not being copied correctly. Creating a slug that simply replaces most characters with hyphens maintained uniqueness but made it easier to reason about how the data was incorrectly formatted. It in the end it may not be wholly necessary, but from a programming perspective it is a bit easier to reason about.2d:Ta2a,WITH customers_db_licenses AS (
