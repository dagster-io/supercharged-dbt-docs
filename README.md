This is a rewrite of [dbt docs](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-docs) using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with React Server Components and SSG.

This project was built primarily by Marco Salazar with contributions by Pete Hunt. It is built on top of the [dbt-docs](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-docs) project.

Want to try this on your own project?
* Replace `catalog.json` and `manifest.json` with the equivalent files from your dbt project
* Run `yarn && yarn build`
* Your docs will be generated in the `dist/supercharged` folder.
